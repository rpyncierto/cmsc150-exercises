Things I learned from this exercise:

Aside from what I've learned in week 5, I discovered that the simplex method is a widely used strategy in the industry/business. Moreover, I visualize it as a graph in which the number of products to be shipped equals the weight of the warehouse and plant edges. The Simplex method determines the feasible and optimal solution or sets of adjacent vertices that will lead to either the minimization or maximization of the objective function. This, I assume, can also be used to schedule exams for the entire university.
