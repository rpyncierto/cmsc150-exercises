Things I learned from making this exercise:
    There are actually numerous of learnings I had in doing this exercise. I have utilized the R shiny or the shiny package in R which is actually a framework in web applications that creates interactive application using R. I actually did notice that it is somehow a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript based on the different methods we can use under this package with the help also of other packages. At first, I didn't really understand a thing other than what I knew in our previous course which introduced us to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, watching youtube videos and reading documentation from RShiny, little by little I understand how it works. I realized also that using this package lets you create a web application and deploy it easily and faster.
