Things I learned from making this exercise:
    The most important thing I learned from this exercise is how to use resources, especially those available on the internet if you want to delve deeper into the topic. While watching and studying the lecture videos, I had some questions, so I did some additional research to answer them. I discovered that quadratic spline interpolation produces a smooth curve over the intervals while also providing a distinct polynomial interpretation of the intervals. It actually improves the estimation by using intervals rather than a single polynomial to fit the data points.
